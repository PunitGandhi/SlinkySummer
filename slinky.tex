We describe a curriculum based around understanding the dynamics of a slinky hung vertically that is released from rest.
The motion, or lack thereof, of the bottom of the slinky after the top is released challenges students' expectations and provides motivation and context for learning about scientific model building.

We present a set of conceptual activities and hands-on experiments to study the falling slinky
which were developed for a week-long summer program for incoming freshmen as a part of the Compass Project~\cite{albana2013}.  
%The summer program is the first part of a three-course sequence aimed at helping incoming students in the physical sciences develop their identity as scientists.
This curriculum helps students learn about the model building process by giving them an opportunity to enlist their collective intellectual and creative resources to develop and explore two different physical models of the falling slinky system. By engaging with two different models, students not only have the opportunity to understand an intriguing counterintuitive phenomenon from multiple perspectives, but also learn deeper lessons about the nature of scientific understanding, the role of physical models, and the experience of doing science.

\section{Introduction}

The basis for the curriculum presented in this work is an experiment involving a slinky
suspended vertically and allowed to come to rest which is then released. As the
slinky falls, the bottommost portion remains at rest until the remainder of the
slinky has fallen down to it.
The slinky drop\NOTEMARG{CB: Shall we define ``falling slinky,'' ``slinky drop,'' or something similar as a technical term at this point for easier reference later?} experiment and other related phenomena have
been studied in detail, \cite{calkin1993, newburgh1995, graham2001, aguirregabiria2007,unruh2011, cross2012},
and the recent flurry of interest in the slinky in the literature and online \cite{..}
are a testament to the curiosity of the subject.
The lack of motion of the bottom of the slinky
served as an interesting, challenging, and counterintuitive phenomenon which our students sought to explain through
the construction of physical models. The phenomenon proved to be very well suited to
teaching the model building process in physics. In this work,
we seek to describe how we used the slinky drop to give the students first-hand
experience constructing two different physical models.

This curriculum was developed for an intensive one-week summer program for
incoming freshmen as a part of the Compass Project~\cite{albana2013,drdf2013a,drdf2013b,Roth2012}. (some
details about compass?) The course was presented in a student-driven classroom
where the role of the instructors is to facilitate discovery and not lecture.
An important aspect of this type of classroom is that the students developed the models
themselves and took ownership over them. This is possible in a classroom with varying science
and math backgrounds because the topic was not a typical high school problem and required
many different skills to analyze.\TODO{Mention somewhere about how the surprising aspects and difficulty
of the slinky drop gave us a way to ``level the playing field'' for students with widely
varying backgrounds.}

%%% The paragraph below is probably more detailed than we need to be about the structure of the program.
% The cirriculum is built around a central question that the students investigate.
%  This central question actually evolves throughout the course of the week as
% student gain understanding and develop a repetoir of scientific tools and
% methods.  The question may start out as "Does the slinky defy gravity?" and end
% up  "How does the bottom of the slinky know when to start falling?"

During the course of the program, we were able to approach the slinky using two different
and highly complemetary models.
One approach, detailed in \sec{forces}, approximated
the slinky by dividing it into discrete masses connected by simple springs and used
forces and Newton's Laws to calculate the motion of these masses.
Despite the conceptual simplicity of the force-based model, the explanation
required a large number of logical steps and a difficult calculation to arrive at
the final conclusion. For this reason, we also made use of a complementary
model based on information, detailed in \sec{information}. This approach attempted
to describe the event when the slinky was let go as a piece of information which
needs to travel to other parts of the system before they are able to respond.
%We used waves to attempt to characterize the speed at which the information travels.
As expected, information proved to be a much more sophisticated concept for the
students to grasp but provided a great deal of insight into the experiment.

The fact that the slinky drop lends itself so naturally to two very different models
makes it an excellent backdrop for teaching model building in science. After presenting each
model individually in \secs{forces}{information}, we compare the models and
discuss model building in general in \sec{discussion}. Finally, our conclusions
are presented in \sec{conclusion}.\NOTE{Can we drop this last sentence?}

\section{Modeling the slinky using forces}
\label{sec:forces}

In this model, we sought to use forces and Newton's Laws to calculate the
motion of the slinky. In order to make this brute-force approach more tractable, we
modeled the slinky as a series of discrete masses connected by simple springs, as
shown in \fig{discrete}. This
model was conceptually very straightforward and allowed the students to follow an
intuitive reductionist approach where they could divide the slinky into individual
constituents and apply familiar rules to each part. Although the model turned out to
be formidable to solve, it was still highly beneficial as it was restricted to the
use of elementary physical concepts, which built up into a larger, more interesting
phenomenon. Students were able to see how the different parts interacted and led
to the suprising behavior of the slinky.

This model can be naturally motivated
by the observation that the slinky appears to be made of a series of discrete rungs.  The students may want 
to treat each rung as a discrete mass, but will soon realize that an idealized model where fewer discrete peices 
with more mass is a more tractible model.  The strategy  was to find the forces (gravity and elastic) acting on 
each mass as a function of position and then
apply Newton's Laws to find the resulting motion. We first approached this model
by actually building such a series of discrete masses and taking measurements of
the motion (\subsec{forcesexperiment}). We then attempted to solve the equations
of motion numerically to find the motion (\subsec{forcesnumeric}).

\subsection{Experimentally testing the simplified model}
\label{subsec:forcesexperiment}

The simplified model of discrete masses connected by springs provides a path forward using
only and introductory level of Newtonian mechanics.  While the physics of this model 
is readily approachable, the math required to analyze the model quickly spirals out of 
the regime of a pencil-and-paper calculation as the number of discrete masses used to model 
the slinky increases.  

%Can the this simplified model based on physics that we understand actually explain a phenomenon
%in which the very physics in the model seems to be defied?

We would like to explore the implications of the model without being constrained by the math.  
The students, with a little coaxing, decided that this could be done experimentally.  They built an 
apparatus that is closely described by the simplified model, so that they could compare its behavior to that of the 
actual slinky.  This was accomplished by tying metal nuts and washers (discrete masses) to 
rubberbands (springs), examples are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:students}.  

%\FIGstudents

the process of attempting to recreate the aspect of the slinky drop of interest using washers and rubberbands  
gave students some insight into the physical properties of the slinky that allowed for the bottom to  remain 
stationary when the top was released.  In particular, the students realized that the models must be very "stretchy"
in order to for this phenomenon to happen.  The students further realized how extremely stretchy the slinky is 
relative to other objects.

This stretchiness can be characterized by how much the object stretches
under it's own weight as it is suspended.   We can define a slinky parameter as a measure of this:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{S}=\frac{m g}{k_\text{eff} L_0 },
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the total mass of the slinky, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration felt as it is suspended, $k_\text{eff}$ is 
the effective spring constant of the entire object, and $L_0$ is the unstretched length.  

Now, in order to see that this parameter is a useful determining the "slinkiness", we can ...


Comparing the physical realization of the model to the slinky 
helps emphasize the distinction between the model and the actual phenomenon of interest.

\subsection{Numerically testing the simplified model}
\label{subsec:forcesnumeric}
Having taken the step toward understanding the slinky using a model with
discrete masses separated by springs, we sought to make further progress by
solving this model numerically. The students spent some time constructing the
force equations for an $N=4$ system, which are
%%%
\begin{align} \label{eq:coupleddes}
m\ddot{x}_1 &= mg + k(x_2 - x_1)\,,
\nn\\
m\ddot{x}_2 &= mg + k(x_3 - x_2) - k(x_2 - x_1)
\,,\nn\\
m\ddot{x}_3 &= mg + k(x_4 - x_3) - k(x_3 - x_2)
\,,\nn\\
m\ddot{x}_4 &= mg                - k(x_4 - x_3)
\,,\end{align}
%%%
\NOTEMARG{CB: include \eq{coupleddes}?}where $m$ is the mass of each discrete mass, $k$ is the spring constant of each
spring, $x_i$ refers to the absolute position of each mass, and the dots refer to
derivatives with respect to time.

Doing any serious exploration of these coupled differential equations
analytically was beyond the level of our audience; however, we briefly allowed
the students to consider how they would solve the system in order to demonstrate
the great difficulty of this strategy.

Students were gradually led toward an alternative numerical approach to solving
the problem that divided the evolution of the system into small time
steps. This was motivated by considering examples like the frames in a
movie. Discretizing time expanded on our previous decision to discretize the mass
in the slinky.

A major goal of this part of the curriculum was to show the benefits of building
numerical models. Not only does a numerical model
practically provide a way to make progress over an exact model which may be difficult
to work with, but these models also often provide a greater degree of transparency and
concreteness into how the system is evolving. We provided the class with the
ponderous analytical solutions to the 4-body system after the activity and asked
them how well they could see what was going on compared to the numerical
approach. We also asked how well they expected each approach to be able to
handle kinks or bends in the slinky to demonstrate the benefit numerical
approaches have in handling perturbations.\NOTEMARG{CB: This paragraph could be removed.
It kind of shows two different sub-models of the force-based model: analytical and numerical.}

For the numerical approach, the students were asked to construct an algorithm
for how to proceed from one time step to the next. With the acceleration at each
step given by the force as in \eq{coupleddes}, the students settled on the
following simple algorithm (also known as the Euler method (Ref. \ref{..})),
%%%
\begin{align} \label{eq:algorithm}
v_i(t+\Delta t) &= v_i(t) + a_i(t)\Delta t
\,,\nn\\
x_i(t+\Delta t) &= x_i(t) + v_i(t)\Delta t
\,,\end{align}
with the time step given by $\Delta t$.

With the algorithm in hand, we had the students ``simulate'' the masses and
springs model as a group. Each mass was represented by a group of 
students, who completed the calculations for their mass to figure out where it would be
at the next time step.
% Students were divided into different roles, with some responsible 
% for calculation, others for communicating their position to other groups who 
% needed the information for their own calculations, and others for plotting the results on a graph 
% at the front of the room.
Groups needed information from other groups in order to complete their calculations,
and the communication of information between groups was intended 
to foreshadow the inherent time delay in the passing of information, explored later in
the week and described in \sec{information}.

% One potential problem is that, for an $N$-body simulation and for the algorithm described in \eq{algorithm},
% it will take $2N$ time steps for the bottom mass to move. This is not an explanation for
% the lack of motion in the real slinky but is rather an artifact of the discretization of time:
% the last mass will always wait $2N$ time steps regardless of the size of the step. One way to
% accelerate the activity would be to use a more accurate symplectic algorithm, such as the
% symplectic Euler algorithm (Ref. \ref{...}). This algorithm would require only $N$ steps to move the bottom
% mass, partially alleviating the tedium for the last group.

The participatory simulation described here provides good practice in building
a model by iteration. After beginning the activity, questions quickly arise, such
as what to do when a mass passes through another mass. Nothing in \eq{coupleddes} prevents
the masses from passing. The students may wish to allow this to happen as an approximation
or they may wish to modify their procedure, perhaps by merging any two masses who have overlaped
in the most recent time step. Follow up questions for discussion or investigation include
the dependence of the simulation on the size of the time step, the number of masses,
and other parameters.\NOTE{CB: Could even expand this paragraph if needed.}

It is also possible to perform this activity using a spreadsheet, which allows the steps to be
calculated much faster, albeit less collaboratively. We had the students implement the algorithm on a spreadsheet once they
felt comfortable with the details of the process. This allowed them to explore some of the follow
up questions more efficiently.

\section{Modeling the slinky using information}
\label{sec:information}
\subsection{Motivating waves as information carriers}        
Coming from the numerical simulation of the masses and springs model, the students realize
two things. First, the numerical model has an artifact that causes the bottom mass to stay stationary.
This should be viewed as a systematic problem with the model, and not a prediction of the model.
Second, when enough time passes so that the bottom mass does move, it initially moves very little compared 
to the distance the upper masses have moved. At this point it becomes clear that the discrete model
is not leading the class to a clear solution to the problem of the falling slinky.

By this this, students likely have brough up the wave propertaies of the slinky. One way of moving forward
is to discuss the idea that there hasn't been enough time for the ``information'' that the top has been 
dropped to reach the bottom. Initialy, the word ``information''
may be ill defined for the students.

This motivated a discussion of ``information travel'' in other contexts like earthquakes, tsunamis, 
sound, or a suspended series of slinkies in the classroom. Students were introduced to the idea that
this information that the top of the slinky had been dropped was being carried in a wave to the bottom
at some speed. Students then investigated properties of waves in small groups. Students investigated the
effects of amplitude, frequency, tension, and material on wave propagation in slinkies.

This model for the slinky contrasted nicely with the previous model. The students were now thinking about
the slinky as a continuous object rather than a set of connected parts.

After the experimental activities, students were introduced to the method of dimensional analysis
to try and derive the speed of a wave on a slinky. They experimentally determined that the wave speed
seemed to be independent of frequency and amplitude, but that it did depend on the material from which
the slinky was made and the amount of tension placed on the slinkies. The quantities that the students
had left to work with were tension, $\tau$, and linear density, $\lambda$. Given these two quantities
the only quantity with units of velocity that can be created is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:wavespeed}
  v=\sqrt{\tfrac{\tau}{\lambda}}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Wave propagation versus the collapsing medium}
The motivating question can be asked more concretely: does the information that the top has been
dropped arrive at the bottom of the slinky before the slinky collapses. Based on the distribution 
of density and tension expected in a suspended slinky, the speed of the wave should decrease as
it travels closer to the bottom of the slinky. On the other hand, the accumulated clump of slinky
continues to accelerate downward due to gravity and then tension in the slinky. It now seems plausible
that the clump might reach the bottom of the slinky before the wave can propagate to the bottom.

This can be verified experimentally. Two identical slinkies were suspended veritcally. One was attached
to a short piece of string that would stop it from dropping after the first few centimeters. In this slinky,
the medium does not collapse and only the wave travels to the bottom. The other was left to free fall. In this
slinky, the clump would accumulate and fall to the bottom. Using a slow-motion camera, the speed of the wave 
and the clump can be measured and compared.


%the students spend the last couple of days on final projects in groups where
%they ask new questions or follow up on outsanding questions that we didn't have
%time for during the week. include a few examples: torsional waves, center of 
%mass, ...

\section{Discussion of Two Models}
\label{sec:discussion}

The fact that the slinky drop lends itself so naturally to two very different models
makes it an excellent backdrop for teaching model building. Having explored both
models, students are able to compare and contrast what kinds of insight are
offered by each one. Which model seems to apply more directly to the overarching
question of the ``levitation?'' Which model uses more basic concepts? Which model
better allows one to see the intermediate evolution of the slinky as it falls?
The models use different fundamental concepts and rules and approach
the problem in very different ways, yet obtain the same results.

Students often approach physics assuming that there is a single ``correct'' way
of looking at a problem. We sought to combat any expectation that we would
provide the ``right'' well-defined model and leave the students to solve it within
comfortable boundaries.
The students constructed a model on their own from basic underlying
principles, figuring out the best perspective to take, selecting which effects
to take into account, and determining which approximations to make.
We then took advantage of the slinky to force the students to attack the problem
from a different angle. Constructing a different model showed the students
how the set of decisions they made the first time around was not necessarily
the unique way of approaching the problem. Multiple acceptable and potentially
useful appoaches were possible for describing the same phenomenon.

Each model makes different parts of the underlying physics
more transparent. The details of the interactions between the successive coils
of the slinky is manifest in the force-based model while the fundamental
limitation in the speed of information travel is less obscured in the model
using waves. Advantages of the force-based model included the students' ready
familiarity with the basic concepts of mechanics required and the straightforward
nature of the strategy of breaking the system into component parts. There were
fewer conceptual hurdles to overcome in this approach, and the mediating
reactions in the middle of the slinky were easy to see. 

Ultimately however, we feel that the information-based model provided the
most direct explanation for the levitation of the bottom of the slinky, despite
its more sophisticated concepts. It focused
on the most relevant concepts for this question and abstracted away
nonessential parts. The great insight provided by the
model demonstrates the idea that the most useful models
capture only the effects that we are most interested in explaining.

\section{Conclusions}
This is an awesome curriculum.  Compass is the best.  The summer program helps
our students identify as scientists.  maybe some short details about the other
two courses?

I think that rather than adding descriptions of the other courses we could just
reference the other Compass paper and describe how the summer program fits in 
with the rest.
